MIS 6900 - Advanced Analytics with Python
=================================================

This is an open access version of most of the content of the [Advanced analytics with Python](http://www.sba.oakland.edu/faculty/isken/courses/mis6900_s21/index.html) course I teach at [Oakland University](). It is NAMOOC (NOT a massively open online course) - it's simply a way of sharing content and course structure ideas. My courses have benefited greatly from the resources and knowledge shared by many in the teaching community. This is my way of giving back.
