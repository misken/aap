Version control with git and GitHub
***********************************


Intro and Objectives
====================

Learning the basics of version control with git and GitHub are pretty essential skills in the data science world. Once you learn to use version control, you'll wonder how you ever did without it. It provides tremendous peace of mind.

After doing the activities in this section, you will be able to:

* understand the basic concepts of version control and the use of git
* create git repos and use git to stage and commit changes
* review the history of changes and revert to old versions
* create remote repos in GitHub and push and pull between local and remote repos

If you have little or no experience with git, I also highly recommend that you:

* Read through the `Version Control with Git lesson <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_ at Software Carpentry (up through using GitHub).



Explore (OPTIONAL)
