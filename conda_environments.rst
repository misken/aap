Conda virtual environments
***********************************

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Intro and Objectives
====================

It is pretty standard practice to use virtual environments and package managers when programming in Python. The Anaconda distribution of Python comes with a tool called *conda* that serves as our virtual environment manager and package (and dependency) manager.

After doing the activities in this section, you will be able to:

* understand the basic concepts of conda virtual environments
* create a conda environment from an existing environment or a configuration file
* install (and uninstall) packages into conda environments using conda as well as pip

Downloads and other resources
=============================

* `Downloads_conda.zip <TODO>`_ 

The following link is the main place I go to when I need to figure out how to do create, delete or modify a conda environment.

* `Managing conda environments <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
