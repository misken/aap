MIS 4900/6900 - Advanced Analytics with Python (Summer 2024)
====================================================================

This course is a follow on to my `MIS 4470/5470 - Practical Computing for
Data Analytics course <http://www.sba.oakland.edu/faculty/isken/courses/mis5470/index.html>`_. In
that course we learn to use both R and Python for various analytical computing tasks. Over
the years, I've found myself wanting to address more topics and issues but the
semester just refused to expand. So, I'm creating this new course and it will
be entirely Python based. You should either have taken MIS 4470/5470 or have
solid Python experience and have taken some data science coursework.

One of the things I want to convey through this course is that business
analytics is **not** synonymous with just data analysis, data viz, and
statistical/machine learning models. While some subset of those things are often part of
analytics projects, many problems require additional modeling approaches such
as simulation and optimization. 

Another goal of the course is for you to develop your skills in using 
Python to solve the myriad of problems and tasks for which we
often use spreadsheets. Using a more computational approach with tools
like Python can lead to better reproducibility and reusability. Along these
lines, I hope to spark a little joy by challenging you to use Python to solve some interesting
and fun computational puzzles. Programming is fun and it's a great feeling when
you get a program working that solves some problem.

Finally, another focal point of the course is an introduction to topics that
are more on the software engineering side of analytics. These skills are
important for helping get analytics based work created, deployed and used. These
topics will be infused throughout the course.
