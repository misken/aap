Here a links to a variety of data science and business analytics related resources.

General business analytics and data science
------------------------------------------------

* `Analytics Magazine`_ It's published by `INFORMS - the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science <https://www.informs.org/>`_. They are the premier professional society for analytics and it's inexpensive to join as a student. Full disclosure, I've been an INFORMS member since about 1986 (when it was still ORSA/TIMS). We were doing analytics before it was called analytics. :)
* `Awesome Data Science <https://github.com/bulutyazilim/awesome-datascience>`_ - giant curated list of data science resources
* There are numerous groups on Reddit related to analytics and data science. These can be very good resources for unvarnished conversations/opinions about careers, grad school as well as technical advice.

    - `r/analytics <https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/>`_
    - `r/OperationsResearch <https://www.reddit.com/r/OperationsResearch/>`_
    - `r/BusinessIntelligence <https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessIntelligence/>`_
    - `r/DataEngineering <https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/>`_

Programming tutorial hubs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Software Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/>`_ and `Data Carpentry <https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/>`_ - helping scientists learn to do computational work with R, Python, SQL and other tools

Online courses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are numerous online courses available through DataCamp, Coursera, EdX, Udemy and others. Here's a few Python and R ones I've checked out over the years.

* `Intro to Data Science in Python`_ - I did this short course in Feb 2017 (Coursera UMich). Great fun.  If you want a good pandas/python learning challenge, try the assignments.
* `Python for Everybody course`_ - This site includes a bunch of videos and  supplementary files. The whole thing was created by a professor at  University of Michigan and is meant to be a totally open set of freely available learning materials for Python in the context of data analysis.
* Coursera has some well regarded `R based data science courses <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r>`_

Learning R
----------

Online tutorials, books and examples for getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `R-bloggers`_- The aggregator for R related blogs.
* `Quick-R`_ - This is a great site dedicated to helping R newbies get over the somewhat steep R learning curve.
* `Cookbook for R`_ - Another great site for learning R. In their words: "The goal of the cookbook is to provide solutions to common tasks and problems in analyzing data."
* `R for Data Science`_ - Free, online version of the book, **R for Data Science** by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
* `The Official R Manuals`_ - These are accessible from the main R Project page in the Documentation section.
* `Contributed Documentation`_ - Many people have written tutorials, books, and other free documentation for various aspects of R. This is part of the magic of R community.
* `Introducing R to a non-programmer in one hour`_ - Just what it says.
* `Webinars from R Studio`_- The creators of the hugely popular R Studio package have a ton of learning resources on their site.
* `Teach yourself Shiny`_- A somewhat recent development by the folks at R Studio is something  called a Shiny web app. Learn to create interactive, R driven, web apps!

Packages
^^^^^^^^^

The R ecosystem relies on high quality packages and its community of package developers. Here are some
collections of package descriptions and links. 

* `RStartHere`_- A very comprehensive and well organized list of packages for doing data science in R.
* `Awesome R`_- Curated list of R packages by category (IDE, data manipulation, etc.)

Learning Python
----------------

Online tutorials, books and examples for getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Software Carpentry - Lessons`_ - Software Carpentry is one of my all time favorite resources for teaching and learning practical programming skills. This link takes you to their  list of "Lessons" (really entire mini-courses). In addition to a lesson on Python, you'll find lessons on tons of stuff that is useful for business analytics and data science. Highly, highly recommended.
* `Whirlwind Tour of Python - Jake VanderPlas`_ - Free 100 page pdf and associated Jupyter notebooks for those who want to learn Python for data science use and have some prior knowledge of programming.
* `Python for Everybody - Charles Severance`_ - This is a remixed, freely available, textbook on learning Python to do data analysis. 



Blogs and listservs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Practical Business Python`_ - Super relevant blog for business students learning Python.
* `Pycoders Weekly`_ - Weekly email newsletter. Always has interesting stuff and almost always something directly data science related.


Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^

* `Awesome Python`_ - A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources


Statistics
-----------------

If you are rusty on statistics, there's a really good OpenIntro Stats book available as a free online book or you can pay what you want for a paperback copy. It includes R based material.

* `OpenIntro Stats <https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/>`_

You can also find high quality `free online statistics courses through the Open Learning Initiative <https://oli.cmu.edu/>`_ as
well as places like Coursera and EdX.

`Cross Validated <https://stats.stackexchange.com/>`_ is a great Q&A forum for all things statistics. Lots of R related
content.
 

Publicly available data
-----------------------

* `Kaggle Datasets <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets>`_ - need to create a free Kaggle account
* `OpenML Datasets <https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active>`_ - site with many ML resources
* `UCI Machine Learning Repository <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html>`_
* `cs109 Resources (2014) <http://cs109.github.io/2014/pages/resources.html>`_ - Many links to datasets (as well as links to Python and misc data science stuff)
* `https://github.com/rstudio/RStartHere#data <https://github.com/rstudio/RStartHere#data>`_ - From the RStartHere site

Workflow and reproducible analysis
----------------------------------

* `Reproducible and Trustworthy Workflows for Data Science <https://ubc-dsci.github.io/reproducible-and-trustworthy-workflows-for-data-science/README.html>`_
* `Data Science Workflow: Overview and Challenges <http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/169199-data-science-workflow-overview-and-challenges/fulltext>`_ - Blog post by Philip Guo who did his dissertation on this topic.
* `Cookiecutter Data Science <https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/>`_ - "A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work."
