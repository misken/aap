Pump it Up: Data Prep
**************************************************

In this submodule, we'll do a little EDA data prep for the ``pumpitup`` project. This isn't meant to be an exhaustive example as our focus is really on classification modeling in Module 2. Nevertheless, there are some useful tips in here including:

* automated EDA tools for Python,
* doing factor lumping with a port of the R package, ``forcats``,
* creating a data prep script,
* getting your data ready for use with sklearn for classification models.

You'll be working in your newly created ``pumpitup`` project folder. 

Start by opening the ``data_prep.ipynb`` notebook in Jupyter Lab.

Here is a screencast to help guide you through the notebook:
